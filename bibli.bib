abstract={On the eve of exascale computing, traditional wisdom no longer applies. High-performance computing is gone as we know it. This article discusses a range of new algorithmic techniques emerging in the context of exascale computing, many of which defy the common wisdom of high-performance computing and are considered unorthodox, but could turn out to be a necessity in near future.},
